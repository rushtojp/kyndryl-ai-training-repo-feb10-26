Here’s a clear, practical guide on **how to get monitoring and observability for Microsoft Copilot**, based on the latest available Microsoft resources and ecosystem tools.

# ✅ **How to Get Monitoring & Observability for Microsoft Copilot**

Microsoft Copilot (including **M365 Copilot**, **Copilot Studio agents**, and **custom AI agents**) does not expose *one single unified observability console* yet. However, **Microsoft provides multiple official paths** to achieve enterprise‑grade monitoring and observability.

Below are the **four primary ways** you can get monitoring and observability for Copilot today.

***

# 🔍 **1. Use Azure Copilot Observability Agent (Preview)**

If your Copilot integrates with **Azure Monitor** (common in enterprise scenarios), Microsoft offers an **AI-powered observability agent** that automatically:

*   Analyzes telemetry from Azure resources
*   Detects anomalies in logs & metrics
*   Correlates signals across systems
*   Generates root‑cause findings with explanations
*   Integrates with alerts and the Azure Monitor workflow

**Use Cases:**

*   Monitoring Copilot workflows tied to Azure functions, APIs, data stores
*   Automatic issue investigations
*   Post‑incident diagnostics

***

# 🔍 **2. Connect Copilot Studio Agents to Azure Application Insights**

If you are building Copilot agents in **Copilot Studio**, Microsoft recommends using **Application Insights** for:

*   Real‑time telemetry
*   Logging & structured events
*   Conversation transcripts
*   Performance metrics (response times, errors, failures)
*   KQL-based analytics
*   Alerts & dashboards

**What You Can Monitor:**

*   User interactions
*   Message sequences
*   Success vs failure rates
*   Response delay outliers
*   Agent decision paths
*   Conversation drop‑offs

**Setup Steps (summary):**

1.  Create an Application Insights resource
2.  Link the connection string to your Copilot Studio agent
3.  View telemetry in Application Insights & Copilot Studio dashboard

***

# 🔍 **3. Use Microsoft’s Observability Guidance for Pro‑Code Copilot Apps**

If you are building **pro-code Copilot extensions**, plug-ins, or AI-powered workflows, Microsoft provides observability best practices:

*   Track LLM lifecycle signals
*   Instrument retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
*   Monitor exception handling
*   Evaluate prompt performance
*   Logging for safety & failure cases

This applies to:

*   Azure AI Foundry
*   Custom copilots
*   Complex multi-agent workflows
*   ISV solutions

***

# 🔍 **4. Use the Copilot Studio Monitor (Governance Tool)**

Because Copilot Studio lacks visibility for admins, the community-created **Copilot Studio Monitor** (built on the Power Platform CoE Kit) helps admins:

*   Inventory all Copilot agents
*   View agent configuration & connectors
*   Track knowledge sources
*   Identify risky or ungoverned agents
*   Feed data into Power BI dashboards

This is especially useful for:

*   Tenant-wide visibility
*   Compliance and governance
*   Understanding agent behavior & dependencies

***

# 🔍 **5. Additional Video-Based Deep Dive (Optional)**

For more context, Microsoft community experts demonstrate:

*   Integrating telemetry
*   Logging best practices
*   Monitoring complex multi-agent workflows
*   Real examples using Application Insights

# 🧭 **Which Option Should You Use?**

| Scenario                         | Best Monitoring Option                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| M365 Copilot usage analytics     | Microsoft Admin Center (built-in reports)             |
| Copilot Studio agents            | **Application Insights** + Copilot Studio dashboard   |
| Azure-based copilots             | **Azure Copilot Observability Agent** + Azure Monitor |
| Multi-agent or pro-code LLM apps | Microsoft Observability for AI + Application Insights |
| Governance across organization   | **Copilot Studio Monitor (Power BI)**                 |
